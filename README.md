# Introduction 
This project is a custom widget for SAP Analytics Cloud. This widget will contain a box-and-whisker plot and a builder to initialize it in SAP Analytics Cloud.

# Getting Started
1.	Software dependencies   
    This widget uses the anychart library to construct a box plot. We chose the anychart library because it has good documentation, gives you the ability to customize the design of charts, and was easy to use in our widget code.
2.	Latest releases   
    Version 0.1.0

# Build and Test
